### What I learned

It's been a while since my last front-end development session, so I decided to start working on Frontend Mentor challenges.

I wanted to start from the very beginning to make sure I covered all of the key topics again because, as previously stated, I am not as competent in front-end development as I once was, so a refresher is in order.

During this challenge, I had the opportunity to reintroduce myself to the Sass world. I hope I did it properly!
